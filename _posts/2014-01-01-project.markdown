description: I developed a source plane reconstruction software which can correct the macroscopic model of cluster lensing potential for residual local perturbations (possibly by dark matter substructures) in the regions around multiple images. As a result, after the correction given by my software, multiple images of one source can be stacked and combined, significantly boosting signal-to-noise ratios of spatially resolved emission line detections.
