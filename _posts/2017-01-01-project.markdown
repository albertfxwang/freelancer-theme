description: A sub-L<sub>&#9733;</sub> galaxy (top; M<sub>&#9733;</sub>~2.3&times;10<sup>9</sup>M<sub>&#9737;</sub>) at z~1.3 showing low-metallicity gas inflow signatures. A dwarf galaxy (bottom; M<sub>&#9733;</sub>~10<sup>9</sup>M<sub>&#9737;</sub>) at z~2 showing strong evidence of metal-enriched outflows triggered by galactic winds.  In both rows from left, I show the color-composite, stellar mass, Balmer line, metallicity maps of these two galaxies with simulated (top; Ceverino et al. 2016) or empirically modeled interpretations (bottom; red arrows denoting net outflow directions) on the far right. I developed effective techniques to extract 2D maps of nebular emission lines flux from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) near-infrared slitless spectroscopy, and metallicity maps using Bayesian inference.  With HST's diffraction limit and gravitational lensing magnification, these maps are spatially sampled at sub-kiloparsec resolution critical to accurately map out the chemical properties of dwarf galaxies and thus probe gas movements within them.
