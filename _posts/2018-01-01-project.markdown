description: To explore the chemo-structural properties of galaxies at cosmic noon (i.e. z~2), I developed a highly effective method for sub-kiloparsec scale spatially resolved spectroscopy of strongly lensed galaxies using space-based wide-field slitless grism data. Applying this method to the deep Hubble Space Telescope near-infrared grism data, I obtained precise gas-phase metallicity maps of 81 star-forming galaxies at z~1.2-2.3, over half of which reside in the dwarf mass regime. My work presents the first statistically representative sample of high-z dwarf galaxies with their metallicity spatial distribution measured with sufficient resolution. These metallicity maps reveal a variety of baryonic physics, such as efficient radial mixing from tidal torques, rapid accretion of low-metallicity gas, and various feedback processes which can significantly influence the chemo-structural properties of dwarf galaxies. 10% of the metallicity gradients measured in our sample are inverted, which are hard to explain by currently existing hydrodynamical simulations and analytical chemical evolution models.
